## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security vulnerbilities must be accompanied by steps to reproduce the attack and must be achievable with a username and password set in the sickchill web client (authenticated means trusted).
Email [miigotu](mailto:miigotu@gmail.com) for vulnerabilities resulting in system privilege escalation, host system infiltration, or exposing user passwords, api keys, or other highly sensitive information.

For all other issues, please make sure the issue exists on the develop branch, and that there are no issues already opened in the past for the issue, or an ongoing PR related tot he issue.
If there is a prior issue related that is closed, please re-use the old closed issue. 
Otherwise, open a new issue on this repository.

There is no guarantee that an issue will be acknowledged or addressed, nor are there any guarantees on if and when a fix might be introduced related to your issue.
If a fix is submitted, code contributions generally are accepted within a few days and merges to master a few days after if not the same day. When there is a fix, we usually want you to have that fix as soon as possible.
