`ifaddr` is a small Python library that allows you to find all the
IP addresses of the computer. It is tested on **Linux**, **OS X**, and
**Windows**. Other BSD derivatives like **OpenBSD**, **FreeBSD**, and
**NetBSD** should work too, but I haven't personally tested those.
**Solaris/Illumos** should also work.

This library is open source and released under the MIT License. It works
with Python 2.7 and 3.5+.

You can install it with `pip install ifaddr`. It doesn't need to
compile anything, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Even on Windows.

----------------------
Let's get going!
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import ifaddr

    adapters = ifaddr.get_adapters()

    for adapter in adapters:
        print("IPs of network adapter " + adapter.nice_name)
        for ip in adapter.ips:
            print("   %s/%s" % (ip.ip, ip.network_prefix))

This will print::

    IPs of network adapter H5321 gw Mobile Broadband Driver
       IP ('fe80::9:ebdf:30ab:39a3', 0L, 17L)/64
       IP 169.254.57.163/16
    IPs of network adapter Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6205
       IP ('fe80::481f:3c9d:c3f6:93f8', 0L, 12L)/64
       IP 192.168.0.51/24
    IPs of network adapter Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection
       IP ('fe80::85cd:e07e:4f7a:6aa6', 0L, 11L)/64
       IP 192.168.0.53/24
    IPs of network adapter Software Loopback Interface 1
       IP ('::1', 0L, 0L)/128
       IP 127.0.0.1/8

You get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The later complete with
flowinfo and scope_id.

---------
Changelog
---------

0.1.7
-----

* Fixed Python 3 compatibility in the examples, thanks to Tristan Stenner and Josef Schlehofer
* Exposed network interface indexes in Adapter.index, thanks to Dmitry Tantsur
* Added the license file to distributions on PyPI, thanks to Tomáš Chvátal
* Fixed Illumos/Solaris compatibility based on a patch proposed by Jorge Schrauwen
* Set up universal wheels, ifaddr will have both source and wheel distributions on PyPI from now on

Alternatives
------------

Alastair Houghton develops `netifaces  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces>`_
which can do  everything this library can, and more. The only drawback is that it needs
to be compiled, which can make the installation difficult.
