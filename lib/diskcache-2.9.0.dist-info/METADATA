DiskCache: Disk Backed Cache
============================

`DiskCache`_ is an Apache2 licensed disk and file backed cache library, written
in pure-Python, and compatible with Django.

The cloud-based computing of 2016 puts a premium on memory. Gigabytes of empty
space is left on disks as processes vie for memory. Among these processes is
Memcached (and sometimes Redis) which is used as a cache. Wouldn't it be nice
to leverage empty disk space for caching?

Django is Python's most popular web framework and ships with several caching
backends. Unfortunately the file-based cache in Django is essentially
broken. The culling method is random and large caches repeatedly scan a cache
directory which slows linearly with growth. Can you really allow it to take
sixty milliseconds to store a key in a cache with a thousand items?

In Python, we can do better. And we can do it in pure-Python!

::

   In [1]: import pylibmc
   In [2]: client = pylibmc.Client(['127.0.0.1'], binary=True)
   In [3]: client[b'key'] = b'value'
   In [4]: %timeit client[b'key']

   10000 loops, best of 3: 25.4 µs per loop

   In [5]: import diskcache as dc
   In [6]: cache = dc.Cache('tmp')
   In [7]: cache[b'key'] = b'value'
   In [8]: %timeit cache[b'key']

   100000 loops, best of 3: 11.8 µs per loop

**Note:** Micro-benchmarks have their place but are not a substitute for real
measurements. DiskCache offers cache benchmarks to defend its performance
claims. Micro-optimizations are avoided but your mileage may vary.

DiskCache efficiently makes gigabytes of storage space available for
caching. By leveraging rock-solid database libraries and memory-mapped files,
cache performance can match and exceed industry-standard solutions. There's no
need for a C compiler or running another process. Performance is a feature and
testing has 100% coverage with unit tests and hours of stress.

Quickstart
----------

Installing DiskCache is simple with
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

  $ pip install diskcache

You can access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-in help
function::

  >>> from diskcache import Cache, FanoutCache, DjangoCache
  >>> help(Cache)
  >>> help(FanoutCache)
  >>> help(DjangoCache)
