        Get the system wide configuration information. Some elements of the API
        require some knowledge of this configuration data. The purpose of this
        is to try and keep the actual API responses as light as possible. It is
        recommended you cache this data within your application and check for
        updates every few days.

        This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as
        well as the change key map.

        To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url,
        size and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully
        qualified URL. Hereâ€™s an example URL:

            https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg

        The configuration method also contains the list of change keys which
        can be useful if you are building an app that consumes data from the
        change feed.
