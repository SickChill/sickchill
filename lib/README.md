Libraries directory
======================

Vendored python packages and custom libraries go in this folder.

Keep this list updated with installed versions and their dependencies,<br/>
and ordered by the top-level library name.

Adding a new package
---------
The best practice is to install the package within a Python **virtual environment** (using `virtualenv`),<br/>
then use `pipdeptree -p PACKAGE` to get a list of the package (+dependencies) versions.<br/>
Add the output to the list below to the appropriate location (based on the top-level package name)
