Description-Content-Type: text/markdown
Requires-Dist: PyOpenSSL
Requires-Dist: pyasn1 (>=0.1.1)

A HTTPS client implementation for 
 * ``httplib`` (Python 2), ``http.client`` (Python 3) and 
 * ``urllib2`` (Python 2) and ``urllib`` (Python 3)

... based on PyOpenSSL.  PyOpenSSL provides a more fully featured SSL implementation 
over the default provided with Python and importantly enables full verification 
of the SSL peer using ``pyasn1``.

Releases
========
0.5.1
-----
 * Clean up handling for description file - pull in content from this file into setup()
 * Allows the nightly build to fail
 * Add Trove version classifiers to make it explicit what is supported
 * Add python_requires to help pip
 * Drop support for EOL Python 2.6 and 3.3  

Thanks to @hugovk for contributions

0.5.0
-----
 * Fix to Subject Alternative Name handling to allow for certificates with
   more than 64 names (max now 1024).  Thanks to Matt Pegler
 * Fix to subjectAltName string to use byte type for correct matching 
 * Updated SSL Context objects to default to TLS 1.2

0.4.4
-----
 * Updated test certificates

0.4.3
-----
 * Fix to ``ndg`` namespace package warning issue (https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/issues/3).  
   ``__init__.py`` file now included in ``ndg`` directory so that there are no longer warnings with imports
   when using Python 2.x.  Thanks to Max Mauntner for fix.
 * Minor fix for installation: set minimum release for ``pyasn1`` to avoid conflicts with Ubuntu
   install - see https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/issues/5 and
   https://github.com/cedadev/ndg_httpsclient/pull/10.  ``pyasn1`` also becomes mandatory rather
   than optional package for install.  - It required by ``cryptography`` anyway which is a 
   dependency for ``pyOpenSSL`` from version 0.14.

0.4.2
-----
 * Fix to bug in ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.open_url`` - duplicate open call.  
   Nb. This bug and the fix DO NOT affect the ``httplib``and ``urllib2`` 
   interfaces that this package provides.

0.4.1
-----
 * Added explicit ref to Python 3 in classifier text for Python 3 checking tools.
 * Moved LICENSE file into package

0.4.0
-----
 * Made dual compatible with Python 2 / 3.

0.3.3
-----
 * Fix to add in AnotherName for ``subjectAltNames`` field - added for support for CACert issued
   certs (thanks to Gu1).
 * Fix to HTTP Basic Auth option for ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.main``
 * Fix to ``ServerSSLCertVerification`` so that it can pass a function-based callback instead of using ``__call__``. In newer versions of OpenSSL (>= 0.14) the latter failed because of a request for ``__name__`` attribute.

0.3.2
-----
 * Fix to SubjectAltNames support check - should only be enabled if pyasn1 is 
   installed.
 * Fix to open_url: HTTP Request object was being created inside if headers is 
   None block - now corrected to create regardless.
 * Added http basic auth support to script. (Thanks to Willem van Engen)

0.3.1
-----
 * extended utils functions to support keyword for passing additional ``urllib2``
   handlers.

0.3.0
-----
 * Added ``ndg.httpsclient.utils.fetch_stream_from_url`` function and added
   parameter for data to post in ``open_url`` and ``fetch_*`` methods.
 * fix to ndg.httpsclient.utils module _should_use_proxy and open_url functions

0.2.0
-----
 * added support for SSL verification with subjectAltNames using pyasn1
 * fixed minor bug - SSL cert DN prefix matching

0.1.0
-----
Initial release

Prerequisites
=============
This has been developed and tested for Python 2.7 with pyOpenSSL 0.13 
and 0.14.  Version 0.4.0 tested with ``pyOpenSSL`` 0.15.1 and Python 2.7 and 
3.4. 
``pyasn1`` is required for correct SSL verification with ``subjectAltNames``.

Installation
============
Installation can be performed using ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.

Running ndg_httpclient
======================
A simple script for fetching data using HTTP or HTTPS GET from a specified URL.

Parameter:

``url``
  The URL of the resource to be fetched

Options:

``-h, --help``
  Show help message and exit.

``-c FILE, --certificate=FILE``
  Certificate file - defaults to ``$HOME/credentials.pem``

``-k FILE, --private-key=FILE``
  Private key file - defaults to the certificate file

``-t DIR, --ca-certificate-dir=DIR``
  Trusted CA certificate file directory.

``-d, --debug``
  Print debug information - this may be useful in solving problems with HTTP or 
  HTTPS access to a server.

``-p FILE, --post-data-file=FILE``
  POST data file

``-f FILE, --fetch=FILE``
  Output file

``-n, --no-verify-peer``
  Skip verification of peer certificate.
