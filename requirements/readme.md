:warning: | IMDbPY | 5.1.1 | Resolved by [#3877](https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage/pull/3877)<br>**Still can't install this from requirements.txt**,<br>because we need to be able to use `--no-deps`, but it's unsupported in the context of requirement files.<br>A workaround seems to be to use `pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt`, which is fine as long as we list ALL dependencies (which is planned).<br>Also, I don't think `install_requires` in `setup.py` supports anything more than simple package version constraints, maybe VCS sources (git/mercurial/etc..) - untested.
