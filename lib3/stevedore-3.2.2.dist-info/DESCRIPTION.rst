Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
("*plugins*") at runtime. Many applications implement their own
library for doing this, using ``__import__`` or ``importlib``.
stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
mechanism by building on top of `setuptools entry points`_. The code
for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore
provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using
dynamically loaded extensions.
