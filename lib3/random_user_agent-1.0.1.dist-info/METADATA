Some of the filter names which can be passed to `UserAgent()` are listed below:

    operating_systems : [
        UNIX, LINUX, WINDOWS, MAC, ...
    ]

    hardware_types : [
        MOBILE, COMPUTER, SERVER, ...
    ]

    software_types : [
        WEB_BROWSER, BOT__CRAWLER, BOT__ANALYSER, ...
    ]

    software_names : [
       EDGE, CHROME, CHROMIUM, ANDROID, FIREFOX, OPERA, ...
    ]

    software_engines : [
       BLINK, GECKO, WEBKIT, ...
